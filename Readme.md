# SEIR-1213 Unit 4 Daily Code Challenges

## Overview 

Over the next week (week 11) you will be tasked with completing a series of coding challenges. These challenges will help you strengthen you problem-solving skills, reinforce your exposure to Python syntax, and give you opportunity to practice your technical interviewing/whiteboarding skills without a time limit. 

## Requirements:

- Each day provides a warmup exercise & 4 challanges - 5 days x 4 problems - 20 challenges total

- Complete 1/2 of the coding challenges for each day, though you should try pseudo-coding all of them. 

- Create a daily pull - include a summary of which problems you completed and any notes about incomplete challenges. 

- This daily activity will count as __one deliverable__.

## Instructions

- Fork and clone this repository

- Solve the challenges by writing your functions in each day's solutions file.   

- Each day's challenges increase in difficulty (0-3)

- Begin with the warm up exercise before continuing on to more demanding challenges 

- Pseudo-code each problem before writing any code

- These are open-notes You are encouraged to use online resources for reviewing python syntax - but try not to google the solution. If you are completely stumped after pseudo-coding, make note of that and move on another challenge.

- If you complete the day's challenge problems early you are encouraged revisit any unfinished deliverables 


## Committing and Pushing your Work

- Your instructors will be checking your progress from time-to-time this week. As you solve the challenges, commit your work. After you have completed the requirements for each day - create / update your PR.
